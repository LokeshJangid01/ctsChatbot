The work in ICUs is a very demanding job, with the training of new staff taking a long time. In this situation, an easy-to-operate mechanical ventilator can help\u00a0 save lives.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Kaan Burak \u00c7AKIRO\u011eLU from SSN Machinery put all the resources of his company into the development of LifeVent in making it easy to handle and producible in short notice. LifeVent is compatible with all hospital systems and consumable materials such as masks, connections to air and oxygen distribution and others.\u00a0 As a result, the user interface is familiar to the staff with minimal training requirements.\u00a0 An operator can learn to use the LifeVent ventilator in less than 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe design of the ventilator is not only focused on high reliability, but on industrial field- proven components from reliable global suppliers\u201d says Kaan. \u201cLifeVent is now going through the latest tests and approvals and will soon be available worldwide. We believe that this new type of ventilator will be a big help for various countries.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For information about Vogtlin mass flow controllers, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voegtlin.com\/massedurchflussmesser-und-massedurchflussregler\/\">https:\/\/www.voegtlin.com\/massedurchflussmesser-und-massedurchflussregler\/<\/a> or contact Marcia Reiff, TASI Flow Marketing Director, at 800-850-6110, e-mail <a href=\"mailto:mreiff@aw-lake.com\">mreiff@aw-lake.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Life Vent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LifeVent is an intensive care ventilator designed to save lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.
