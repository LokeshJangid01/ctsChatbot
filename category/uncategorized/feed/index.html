										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>TASI Test and Automation to continue to expand product and service offerings in this new era of growth</strong></h2>
<p>As of January 1, 2024, the TASI Group is restructured into two individual organizations: TASI Test and Automation (<u><a href="https://tasigroup.com/">tasigroup.com</a></u>), and TASI Measurement (<u><a href="http://tasimeasurement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasimeasurement.com</a></u>).</p>
<p>TASI Test and Automation focuses on advanced test, inspection, and assembly solutions for the manufacturing industry that improve production processes and deliver value-added results. It is comprised of three segments: Product Integrity, Packaging Integrity, and Automation. For more information on the companies under TASI Test and Automation, please visit <u><a href="https://tasigroup.com/">tasigroup.com</a></u>.</p>
<p>TASI Measurement provides flow measurement technologies for industrial markets, including water &amp; wastewater, irrigation, chemical processing, and oil and gas.

<p>Hospitals worldwide face two challenges in caring for patients in intensive care units:</p>
<ol>
<li>A worldwide shortage of mechanical ventilators in nearly all countries.</li>
<li>Untrained nurses to operate ventilators. The work in ICUs is a very demanding job, with the training of new staff taking a long time. In this situation, an easy-to-operate mechanical ventilator can help  save lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kaan Burak ÇAKIROĞLU from SSN Machinery put all the resources of his company into the development of LifeVent in making it easy to handle and producible in short notice. LifeVent is compatible with all hospital systems and consumable materials such as masks, connections to air and oxygen distribution and others.  As a result, the user interface is familiar to the staff with minimal training requirements.  An operator can learn to use the LifeVent ventilator in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>“The design of the ventilator is not only focused on high reliability, but on industrial field- proven components from reliable global suppliers” says Kaan. “LifeVent is now going through the latest tests and approvals and will soon be available worldwide. We believe that this new type of ventilator will be a big help for various countries.”</p>

<h2><strong>Cassel’s capabilities amplify TASI Packaging Integrity Group’s customer-focused mission to help ensure packaging quality, protecting end-users worldwide </strong></h2>
<p>MARLBOROUGH, MA and DRANSFIELD, Germany, February 12, 2020</p>
<p>TASI Group (<a href="https://tasigroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.tasigroup.com</a>) and Cassel Messtechnik GmbH (Cassel) (<a href="http://www.cassel-inspection.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.cassel-inspection.com</a>) announce their strategic alliance, as TASI Group acquires Cassel, eﬀective January 31, 2020. The acquisition will enable the Packaging Integrity segment of TASI Group &#8211; which includes ALPS Inspection, Sepha, and Bonfiglioli Engineering &#8211; to further expand its global reach in product inspection and packaging integrity and reinforce their mission to help customers ensure the highest quality in product manufacturing.</p>
<p>Cassel is a leader in the design and construction of metal detection and x-ray inspection systems for industrial applications. With over 60 employees located near Hannover, Germany, Cassel provides manufacturers with the testing equipment necessary for quality control and ensuring the safety of consumer goods. Cord Cassel, who founded the company over 25 years ago says, &#8220;Cassel has experienced strong growth and was looking for the right strategic partner to help take the business to the next level. I feel confident that an alliance with TASI will not only reinforce our current position but will help  strengthen and grow our presence in our key industries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Cassel and TASI are motivated by quality and driven to provide solutions that enable their customers to provide products of the highest integrity. Like other TASI Group Packaging Integrity businesses, Cassel has earned its long-standing reputation by protecting the reputations of their customers.</p>
<p>Kris Fairﬁeld, President of TASI Packaging Integrity, anticipates realizing many synergies between the businesses. “As our customers are at the center of everything we do, I am inspired by the expanded solutions we’ll provide that enable our customers to provide the best quality product to their end-users,” he says. “We are not only welcoming more than 60 talented colleagues to the Packaging Integrity team and the greater TASI Group family, but we are also strengthening and expanding our innovative solutions portfolio to the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, personal care, and building materials markets by oﬀering a complete line of metal detectors and packaging x-ray machines.”</p>
<p>“The acquisition of Cassel completely aligns with our strategy to add adjacent technologies and to build out our Package Integrity Segment,” notes TASI CEO John McKenna.</p>
