<p>The TASI Group recently acquired <a href="https://www.onicon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ONICON</a>, a private company specializing in the design and manufacture of flow meters and energy measurement systems. ONICON addresses liquid flow, steam flow, natural gas flow, airflow, and thermal energy applications with a broad range of flow meter technologies, including electromagnetic, turbine, ultrasonic, thermal mass, vortex, Pitot tube and BTU meters. Through its own acquisitions, ONICON offers six brands including:</p>
<p>• ONICON<br />
• Air Monitor<br />
• Seametrics<br />
• Fox Thermal<br />
• Greyline<br />
• Pulsar</p>
<p>The organization joins the TASI Flow Segment of complementary businesses which includes:</p>
<p>• AW-Lake Company<br />
• KEM Kuppers Electromechanik GmbH<br />
• Litre Meter<br />
• SignalFire Wireless Telemetry<br />
• Vogtlin Instruments GmbH<br />
• EXACT Dispensing Systems</p>
<p>The ONICON acquisition is another is step in the continuing development of TASI’s premier flow and level measurement business. The combined businesses now form a substantially larger TASI Flow Segment that offers an extensive range of technology to better serve customers around the globe and extend into new markets.</p>
<p>“The ONICON acquisition is a strategic win for everyone,” stated TASI CEO John McKenna. “ONICON’s diversified portfolio of flow technologies compliment TASI Flow businesses with little overlap in technology, industries and geographic regions. This acquisition positions both businesses on an aggressive growth path.”</p>
<p>John Norris, former ONICON President and Chief Executive Officer, will serve as TASI Flow Segment President with responsibilities for overseeing the entire combined group of world-class flow businesses. He will report directly to John McKenna the TASI Group CEO.</p>
